    <p><strong>Chi Hack Night</strong> is a free, weekly event in Chicago to build, share and learn about tools to create, support, and serve the public good.</p>

    <p>We are a group of thousands of designers, academic researchers, data journalists, activists, policy wonks, web developers and curious citizens who want to make our city more just, equitable, transparent and delightful to live in through data, design and technology.</p>

    <h3 id='what-happens'>What happens at a hack night?</h3>
    
    <p>Chi Hack Night starts every Tuesday at 7pm. The event is free, and the invitation is open to anyone, especially folks who aren’t programmers.</p>

    <p>Here's what happens at Chi Hack Night every week:</p>

    <p><strong>7:00pm – Welcome and announcements</strong></p>

    <p>We get started around 7:00pm with a brief welcome and introduction to the event and then kick off the announcements.</p>

    <p>Announcements are for civic tech and open government related things. This could be plugging other events, mentioning newsworthy articles and more recently, job announcements in the government and civic tech space</p>

    <p><strong>7:15pm – Presentation with Q&amp;A</strong></p>

    <p>Just about every week, we have a feature presentation that lasts about 25 minutes, with 20 minutes for question &amp; answer (Q&amp;A) after.</p>

    <p>Presenters can be any government agency, non-profit, company or group who’ve made use of open government data or built a civic technology application. Anyone can propose a talk, and I often reach out to presenters who would be a good fit. For every speaker, we provide some clear <a href="http://chihacknight.org/speaker-submissions.html">speaker guidelines</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>8:00pm – 10:00pm - Breakout into learning and prototyping groups</strong></p>

    <p>Once the presentation wraps up, the format of the event switches up to what I’d describe as a mini-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathon</a>. People are invited to break off into groups and work on projects.</p>

    <p><a href="http://chihacknight.org/breakouts.html">Breakout groups</a> that last more than a few weeks are listed on the <a href="http://chihacknight.org/">ChiHackNight.org</a> website, and are divided into two tracks: learning groups and prototyping groups.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Learning Groups</strong> - Learning groups are for new folks (about 30% of attendees on any given week are new), those who want to learn technology skills, and discuss or refine their civic app ideas.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Prototyping Groups</strong> - Topic-specific working groups led by facilitators to guide conversations, answer questions, and prototype civic apps.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <hr />
    <h3 id='everyone'>Everyone is welcome!</h3>

    <p>Not a techie? <strong>That's ok!</strong> We encourage non-technical folks to pair up and <a href='/breakouts.html'>learn</a> from our community's <a href='/open-source-people.html'>designers and developers</a>. We've seen time and time again, the best <a href='/open-source-projects.html'>civic projects</a> come from teams with a diverse background.</p>

    <p><strong>Remember</strong>, there's much more to making a great app than just coding.</p>
