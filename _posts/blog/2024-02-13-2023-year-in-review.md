Ahead of our fifth annual Member Meeting and Board Elections on Feb 13, 2024, we’re publishing our 2023 year in review to share with our Members and our community (that’s you!).

As we look ahead to 2024, we also look back at what we did in 2023. Here we go …

For those newer to Chi Hack Night, this is the ninth “year in review” that we have done. Take a look at our year-in-review posts from [2022](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2023/02/07/2022-year-in-review), [2021](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2022/02/22/2021-year-in-review.html), [2020](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2021/02/06/2020-year-in-review.html), [2019](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2020/02/04/2019-year-in-review.html), [2017](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2018/01/04/2017-year-in-review.html),[ 2016](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/12/31/2016-year-in-review.html),[ 2015](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2015/12/22/chi-hack-night-2015-year-in-review.html), and[ 2014](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2015/01/06/open-gov-hack-night-2014-year-in-review.html) to follow along how we got here.

In that tradition, here are the high-level statistics for Chi Hack Night in 2023:

## Finances {#finances}

Chi Hack Night continues to remain financially stable and is in a good position to continue covering our remote as well as hybrid remote/in-person events well into 2024. Expenses remained substantially lower than they were pre-pandemic, although we did have higher legal and licensing/registration expenses in 2023 as we worked with our lawyer to resolve an error in our registration with the Illinois Attorney General’s office.

In 2023, we received donations from several individuals throughout the year (thank you to those who donated, especially those contributing on a monthly basis!). We also continued to see  organizations providing sponsorship donations to Chi Hack Night (thank you, Chicago Cityscape and DataMade!).

In-person events remained the main expense for 2023, which included professionally recording and editing the in-person presentations as well as providing food, snacks, and supplies at such events. We also saw presenters continuing to take advantage of Chi Hack Night’s honorarium for speakers.

## Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) {#objectives-and-key-results-okrs}

For our 4th year, the Board has been using OKRs to prioritize what we’ve determined to be areas to focus our efforts to improve our event & build our community. Below, we will recap how we are doing halfway into our [2023 - 24 OKRs](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2023/08/22/2023-retreat-okrs). 

**Progress Key**

_Whether we will achieve this by  June 30, 2024_

## Introducing … Chi Hack Night KPIs! {#introducing-chi-hack-night-kpis}

We love data, right? So why wouldn’t we love data about Chi Hack Night? 

New to this year, we introduced monitoring around our KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) - meaning the data points we have decided are crucial to understand the health of Chi Hack Night.


These are things like…
* Zoom Post-Presentation Attendance
* In Person Attendance
* YouTube Livestream Viewers
* YouTube Hours Watched
* Website Views
* LinkedIn Follower Growth

Each board meeting, we’ve spent a few minutes reviewing the latest data & how it relates to our past performance. 

Unfortunately, we are either seeing no change - or in some cases - a downward trend in some of our key metrics such as…

**Zoom Post-Presentation Attendance**
<p class="text-center"><img src="/images/blog/2023-year-in-review/post-livestream-attendance.png" alt="Post-livestream attendance in 2023" class='img-responsive'/><br /><em>Post-livestream attendance in 2023 has been consistently averaging around 20 attendees a night</em>
</p>


**YouTube - Hours Watched by Month (including Livestream)**
<p class="text-center"><img src="/images/blog/2023-year-in-review/youtube-hours-watched.png" alt="YouTube Hours Watched in 2023 by Month" class='img-responsive'/><br /><em>YouTube Hours Watched in 2023 by Month has been steadily trending downwards</em>
</p>

In short, it’s evident to the Board that we are not doing enough to grow our event. Outside of our LinkedIn followers, we have no metric that represents _growth_ for Chi Hack Night. It is certainly something that we will continue to monitor as a board & adjust our plans to get these metrics trending upwards. 

Thus concludes our 2023 recap. Thanks for reading it. Here’s to a great 2024 for Chicago’s civic tech community! See you Tuesday!
