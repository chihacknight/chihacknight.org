    <em>The Chi Hack Night crowd awaits the start of Lightning Talks! Part Deux</em>
</small>
</p>

On July 19th 2016, we heard from 9 members of Chi Hack Night on the projects they’ve worked on and the lessons they’ve learned from our community.

Though there was no defined theme or coordination among the presenters, all 9 talks ended up focusing on the topics of empathy, inclusion and progress.

Over the years as a community, we’ve learned about our city, ourselves and what we’re capable of. Each of the talks listed below are a testament to that growth. You can also watch the [YouTube playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_dBjjdnIbKwcnmL2aJ68IjvP_kY8d7_6).

### 3. Eureka Foong: Why Ignorance Matters at Hack Night 

After participating in several groups at hacknight, including Access to Justice, Eureka learned that "hackers" are motivated to improve their own skills. But how can we also improve the projects we work on? The answer lies in finding a happy middle in ignorance.

### 7. Claire Micklin: My Building Doesn't Recycle: The Final Frontier? 

Since Claire's last lightning talk, there have been some exciting developments with [My Building Doesn't Recycle](http://mybuildingdoesntrecycle.com/). [A stronger recycling ordinance was introduced](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/07/15/recycling-reform-is-on-the-horizon-in-chicago.html) by the Mayor's office and passed City Council on July 20.

How did the app have its desired impact? What are the ingredients of an app that gets the attention of policymakers?

### 8. Benjamin Cooper: Learning to Listen

When we create Civic Tech, we are inherently subscribing to some sort of vision of what we want our community to be. All of us have different values but broadly speaking, we want to make our community better for *everyone*. 

Ben describes a problem with this: the people building this tech probably live very different lives that the majority of people in our community. In that context, listening to the community and learning from it to deploy our skills in the right direction is important.
