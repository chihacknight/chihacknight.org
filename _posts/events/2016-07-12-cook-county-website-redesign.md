Cook County has a [beautiful](http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20160706/BLOGS02/160709932/cook-county-rolls-out-a-thing-of-beauty-honest) new website: [www.cookcountyil.gov](https://www.cookcountyil.gov/)!

[Kathy Lynch](https://twitter.com/@Kathy_TechCom), IT Communications Manager at the [Cook County Bureau of Technology](https://twitter.com/@cookcountytech), will tell the story of how the new Cook County website came to be. 

The old-school way of designing government websites was to build an online copy of what existed in the physical world - a page for each office, agency and elected official. The new County website still has these pages, but its focus is on quickly getting visitors to the services the County provides. 

Kathy will also talk about their design process, which included input from Smart Chicago's [Civic User Testing Group](http://www.cutgroup.org/) and their new streamlined content management system.
