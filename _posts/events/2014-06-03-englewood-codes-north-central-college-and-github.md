[Englewood Codes](http://englewood.codes/) is back!

For their undergraduate capstone project, computer science students at [North Central College](http://www.northcentralcollege.edu/home) partnered with [Teamwork Englewood](https://twitter.com/tmwkenglewood) to build a browser-based editor, or IDE, for Englewood Codes using the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/).

The team will talk about the development process, demo the app and share how Teamwork Englewood plans to use the IDE to teach more Chicago youth how to code.
