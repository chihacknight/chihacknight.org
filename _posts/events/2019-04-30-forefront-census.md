[IL Count Me In 2020](http://ilcountmein2020.org) has three main objectives:

1.       Ensure coordination with the State’s Complete Count Commission;
2.       Facilitate and manage a statewide advocacy coalition of nonprofits with a steering committee of trusted community-based organizations to help lead outreach efforts;
3.       Facilitate and manage an IL funders’ collaborative to help raise funding for community-based organizations to do outreach work in hard-to-count communities across the State.

Forefront’s goal for the Illinois Count Me In 2020 program is to provide educational Census outreach statewide, while serving as a resource for Grantmakers, government and nonprofit organizations to ensure statewide Census outreach coordination. The ultimate goal of Forefront’s work is for 90% of Illinoisans to be counted (compared to 78%) in 2010.
