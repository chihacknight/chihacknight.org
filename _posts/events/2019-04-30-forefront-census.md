title: "IL Count Me In 2020: Making the Case for a fair and accurate Census count in Illinois next year"
description: "As part of Forefront’s Democracy Initiative, Forefront is mobilizing our nonprofit and foundation members alike to encourage all Illinoisans, and especially members of traditionally hard-to-count populations, to participate in the upcoming 2020 Census. Through Forefront’s Census outreach work, Forefront is advocating for a fair, accurate and coordinated Census outreach across the State, working in partnership with elected officials, Grantmakers, and nonprofit, community leaders on the importance and impact of the 2020 census."

The project titled “IL Count Me In 2020” has three main objectives:

1.       Ensure coordination with the State’s Complete Count Commission;
2.       Facilitate and manage a statewide advocacy coalition of nonprofits with a steering committee of trusted community-based organizations to help lead outreach efforts;
3.       Facilitate and manage an IL funders’ collaborative to help raise funding for community-based organizations to do outreach work in hard-to-count communities across the State.

Forefront’s goal for the Illinois Count Me In 2020 program is to provide educational Census outreach statewide, while serving as a resource for Grantmakers, government and nonprofit organizations to ensure statewide Census outreach coordination. The ultimate goal of Forefront’s work is for 90% of Illinoisans to be counted (compared to 78%) in 2010. For more information, please visit www.ilcountmein2020.org.
