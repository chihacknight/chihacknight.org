[Daniel X. O'Neil](https://twitter.com/danxoneil) of the [Smart Chicago Collaborative](http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/) will talk about the [Civic User Testing Group](http://www.cutgroup.org/), a set of regular Chicago residents who get paid to test out civic apps.

Dan and his colleagues will give a brief presentation about the [impetus behind the program](http://www.cutgroupbook.org/2-origins/) and cover its three essential [components](http://www.cutgroupbook.org/3-components/): UX testing, digital skills, and community engagement. They'll also talk about how the Civic Tech community here in Chicago can get involved in this program which is being implemented all over the country.
