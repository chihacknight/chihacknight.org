[TechGirlz](https://www.techgirlz.org/) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to reducing the gender gap in technology occupations, by focusing on girls at the crucial middle school age. They offer free workshops to get girls interested in different kinds of technology, show them varied career options, and connect them with professionals in technology fields.

TechGirlz believe that there's more to tech careers than just coding. They're here to show middle school girls just that. 

[Joan Matz](https://www.techgirlz.org/team/joan-matz/), TechGirlz Chicago Outreach Manager will discuss their free hands-on TechShopz, where they show middle school girls that technology can match their interests and be fun and rewarding.
