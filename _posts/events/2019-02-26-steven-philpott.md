[Steven Philpott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sphilpott/) is the Sr. Managing Director of Colony 5, a not-for-profit organization accelerating the redevelopment of distressed retail corridors via tech entrepreneurship.

At Chi Hack Night, Steven will share his work on the Array of Opportunity, a pilot collaboration between the research community and innovators to develop prototypes for social impact and commercial implications in a concentrated geolocation. The endgame of this project is to demonstrate how Opportunity Zones can be future-forward, more responsive and attractive to investment by exposing edge-tech initiatives within these communities.

Join this session that introduces the Array of Opportunity premise, pilot community, and collaborative approach.
