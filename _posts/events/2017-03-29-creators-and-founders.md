Chi Hack Night, in partnership with the [Smart Chicago Collaborative](http://smartchicagocollaborative.org/), is proud to present our first ever [Womenâ€™s History Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_History_Month) Speaker Series. Throughout the month of March, we will feature amazing women speakers in the civic, nonprofit and technology space.

This panel will shine a light on women who have launched start-ups and applications in service to the Chicago tech ecosystem. How did they get their start? What challenges did they encounter and what can we learn from their stories? We will learn from the creative trailblazers in the field and start a conversation about supporting and catalyzing women founders in all of our neighborhoods.
