[Zach Borders](https://twitter.com/oskeewowza) will tell us about [Civic ArtWorks](http://www.civicartworks.com/), a company dedicated to empowering citizens and providing them with the tools to become more engaged in the design processes that shape the future of their neighborhood. 

Come learn about the work they are doing in communities as large as Chicago and as small as Plainfield and hear about their work in communications, data analysis, and visualization.
