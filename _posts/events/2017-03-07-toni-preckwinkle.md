Chi Hack Night, in partnership with the [Smart Chicago Collaborative](http://smartchicagocollaborative.org/), is proud to present our [Women in Tech speaker series](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2017/03/07/presenting-the-women-in-tech-speaker-series.html) celebrating Women's History Month. Throughout the month of March, we will feature amazing women speakers in the civic, nonprofit and technology space.

This week, we are honored to welcome [Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle](https://www.cookcountyil.gov/person/toni-preckwinkle).

President Preckwinkle has been a dedicated community leader for over two decades. She has worked with the [Cook County Board of Commissioners](https://www.cookcountyil.gov/board-of-commissioners), elected officials and County employees to implement major reform and reshape County government through fiscal responsibility, innovative leadership, transparency and accountability, and improved services.

President Preckwinkle will talk about strategies for collaborative approaches that can drive positive change in Cook County.
