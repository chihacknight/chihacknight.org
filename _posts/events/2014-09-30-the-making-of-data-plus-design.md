This year, more than 50 people in 14 countries worked together to write a free, 300-page e-book that explains important data and visualization concepts in friendly language. [Data + Design: A simple introduction to preparing and visualizing information](https://infoactive.co/data-design) is an open source e-book that describes [data collection](https://infoactive.co/data-design/part02.html), [preparation](https://infoactive.co/data-design/part03.html), [storytelling and visualization](https://infoactive.co/data-design/part04.html).

In this meetup, co-organizers [Trina Chiasson](https://twitter.com/trinachi) and Dyanna Gregory will talk about the process of writing a collaborative, global, open source book about the intersection of data and design.
