<p>New York City recently released <a href='http://www.checkbooknyc.com/'>Checkbook NYC</a>, a transparency app that shows the city's budgets, contracts, and payrolls. They also took the unprecedented step of <a href='https://github.com/NYCComptroller/Checkbook'>open sourcing the code</a>, and our our friend <a href='http://www.red-bean.com/kfogel/'>Karl Fogel</a> helped them do it. Karl will talk about the project, the backstory of how it was opened, and his plans to stand it up in Chicago.</p><p>Following on last week's git tutorial, <a href='http://derekeder.com/'>Derek Eder</a> will be teaching interested people the basics of making maps with <a href='https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232?hl=en'>Google Fusion Tables</a>. Always wanted to learn? Now's your chance.</p>
