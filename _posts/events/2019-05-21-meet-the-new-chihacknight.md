This week marks Chi Hack Night's 350th event and 7th anniversary! 

What started in a tiny room in 1871 as a place for people to discuss the open data movement and work with the new information that was coming from the city of Chicago has grown into one of the best-known civic tech events in the city. In 2018, Chi Hack Night community leaders and participants made the decision to incorporate as a non-profit to ensure the future of the organization and to adopt a structure that would better serve both the community of CHN and the city of Chicago. 

Please join us this Tuesday to learn more about the history of Chi Hack Night and its incorporation and governing structure. There will be a presentation on where Chi Hack Night has come from, the process of incorporation, and a facilitated discussion to find out more about how Chi Hack Night can better serve its members and attendees. 

We hope to see you there!
