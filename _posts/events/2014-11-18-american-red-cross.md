[Jim McGowan](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/jim-mcgowan/1b/ab2/810) will demonstrate how the [American Red Cross](http://www.redcross.org/) has transitioned from managing daily disaster responses with paper, Word docs and Excel spreadsheets to a volunteer-created, open source, incident management and responder scheduling application. 

DCSOps (short for Disaster Cycle Services Operations) is used to dispatch and track more than 2,300 disasters annually in the 13-county Greater Chicago Region and has recently been deployed in New York and Los Angeles.
