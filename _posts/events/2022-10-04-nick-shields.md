There’s nothing more vital to a person’s chances of success than supporting their development in the first years of life, including easy access to high-quality early education opportunities.

High-quality childcare, pre-kindergarten, and elementary schooling are game changers for kids. Unfortunately, not all our children have access to these beneficial programs. Cook County is very concerned by the existing educational inequities that have been exacerbated by COVID-19 and is committed to doing all it can to support children’s growth and development, no matter their zip code.

While nothing can replace the effectiveness of live, in-person learning, extensive research shows that children’s television programming and other forms of educational media can significantly improve children’s mental and social development. Cook County launched [Project Rainbow](https://projectrainbow.cookcountyil.gov/), new high-quality educational TV programming for children and families in 2021. The content is available on County TV (Channel 22, 900 on Comcast), the Cook County website, Facebook, and on the free Cook County Project Rainbow mobile app.
