Chi Hack Night, in partnership with the [Smart Chicago Collaborative](http://smartchicagocollaborative.org/), is proud to present our first ever [Womenâ€™s History Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_History_Month) Speaker Series. Throughout the month of March, we will feature amazing women speakers in the civic, nonprofit and technology space.

Women in Chicago play a crucial role in leveraging technology to engage residents in civic issues. What paths brought them to their current roles and how have their experience influenced their work? What drives them and what have they learned? Hosted in a neighborhood space, this event will catalyze a conversation about how women can amplify the voices of their communities and neighborhoods.
