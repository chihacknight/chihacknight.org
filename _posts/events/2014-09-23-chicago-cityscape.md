[Steven Vance](https://twitter.com/stevevance) will share with us the evolution of [Chicago Cityscape](http://www.chicagocityscape.com/) (formerly known as Licensed Chicago Contractors), a site that combines building permits data with other information from the [Chicago open data portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) to give an overview of changing neighborhoods – of buildings going up and coming down – anywhere in the city.

Both Derek and Christopher will be out of town for the Code for America Summit, so [Scott Beslow](https://twitter.com/sbeslow) and [Rose Afriyie](https://twitter.com/RoseSerwah) will be running the show!
