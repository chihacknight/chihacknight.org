<p>We're having a joint event with the <a href='http://www.cnt.org/'>Center for Neighborhood Technology</a>. CNT is doing their annual <a href='http://www.cnt.org/events/reinventing-chicago-2013-urban-sustainability-apps-competition/'>Urban Sustainability Apps Competition</a>, where community activists and app developers will work together to build tools to that make Chicago neighborhoods more sustainable, both environmentally and economically.</p><p>The main event is a weekend hackathon from Oct 18th-20th, but teams will form and start working at the hack night this week and next. (Of course, you don't have to participate in CNT's hackathon to show up!)</p>
