The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated xenophobia and bigotry towards Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, leading to dramatic increases in hate crimes, ranging from business vandalism to physical violence. Since March 2020, over 6,000 incidents of anti-Asian hate have been reported in the United States. Data shows that women made up 65 percent of the reports. Businesses have been the primary sites of discrimination. However, this is just another chapter in a long timeline of anti-Asian violence that has always been woven throughout America’s history.

Local Chicago community organizers have mobilized to launch [Celebrate Argyle](https://celebrateargylechicago.com/), a community initiative that celebrates AAPI individuals, restaurants, and Asia on Argyle’s rich and dynamic history, while connecting community members and businesses to critical resources to meet pressing needs through the pandemic and beyond. Join the Celebrate Argyle team for a discussion on unpacking the AAPI experience, understanding and addressing past and current challenges, and elevating AAPI voices. Learn how to co-conspire and advocate with the AAPI community, and also celebrate the diversity of AAPI communities during Asian Pacific Heritage Month May 2021.
