[Rose Afriyie](https://twitter.com/RoseSerwah), Marina Goldshteyn and Ellie Day will demo [mRelief](http://mrelief.herokuapp.com/), a site that allows anyone to check their eligibility for social service benefits in Chicago and Illinois. The site, catalyzed by the Chi Hack Night, has already launched in the [Martin Luther King Community Service Center](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/fss/provdrs/serv/svcs/community_servicecenterlocations.html) on South side of Chicago. 

Rose will demo the key programs available in Chicago's Community Service Centers and [Joseph Flesh](http://www.linkedin.com/in/josephflesh) from [Purple Binder](http://purplebinder.com/) will discuss their partnership with mRelief to provide a reliable source of local community resources.
