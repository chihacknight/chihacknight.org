How can technology make government more efficient, nimble, or otherwise add value to the user experience? [Technology Transformation Services (TTS)](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) are a team of about 300 people specializing in design, engineering, strategy, product, data, artificial intelligence, cloud adoption, and more — all federal employees — working to improve the public’s experience with government. TTS/18F has offices in DC, San Francisco, Chicago and New York, as well as team members working remotely from all over the country.

On Tuesday, some of the local TTS/18F team will be sharing about the projects — [Open Forest](https://openforest.fs.usda.gov/) with U.S. Forest Service, [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/) and [login.gov](https://login.gov/) — that deliver high impact outcomes, how TTS/18F operates and collaborates with other agencies through agile, user-centered, and open development processes, and how you can get involved.
