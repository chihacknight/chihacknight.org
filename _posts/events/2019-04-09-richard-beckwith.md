Richard Beckwith is a Research Psychologist in the Experience Insights Lab of Intel’s Interactions and Experiences Research group. He focuses primarily on education, agriculture, and privacy. He received his Ph.D. from Teachers College, Columbia University in 1986. From 1986 to 1991 he was a research scientist at Princeton University’s Cognitive Science Lab, working on WordNet. From 1991 until coming to Intel, he was a Research Faculty member at Northwestern University in the Institute for the Learning Sciences (ILS).

On Tuesday, he'll be speaking about his recent work conducting interviews with Chicago city residents and municipal leadership to understand how the community feels about smart city tech and what kinds of services would be desired of a Smart Community. This will serve to develop a set of questions for a city government to consider when they decide to adopt new smart city technologies, especially ones that could be considered “surveillance technologies”.

Richard is also an adviser to the Colony 5 Array of Opportunity project, which is intent on building new tech to support the community in Englewood and similar communities with a focus on the Chicago-wide “Array of Things” and the planned drone program for supporting first responders.
