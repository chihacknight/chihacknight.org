Digital security alone may not be sensational, but paired with daily reports of large-scale cyber-attacks, it is a topic that deserves the spotlight. From big tech, to city offices, to the meat industry, no person or organization is immune to a hack, and anyone can be a target. This means that securing digital accounts and personal data is important now more than ever, but it is becoming increasingly difficult as the vast threat landscape continues to grow. However, protecting these assets is not as daunting as it may seem. With a few tools and a little bit of knowledge, simple steps can be taken to drastically up one's digital security game and reduce the likelihood of falling victim to a malicious attack.

Enter: Chi Hack Night's very own digital security experts. In this presentation, they will demonstrate how hackers acquire sensitive information and what to do if that information is compromised. They will also discuss how to create strong passwords that are impossible to crack, and how to identify the red flags in phishing emails. The tips and tricks that they will share are not limited to the tech-savvy or a company's IT department - in fact, everyone can and should be responsible for their own digital security.
