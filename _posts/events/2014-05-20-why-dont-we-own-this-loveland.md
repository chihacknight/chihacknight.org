Jerry Paffendorf from [Loveland](http://www.makeloveland.com/) will be talking about the amazing work his outfit has been doing in Detroit, from opening up the Motor City's property data through [Why Don't We Own This](http://www.whydontweownthis.com), to fighting blight by helping residents buy vacant properties from local governments, to surveying every single property in the city through their [Blexting](http://www.hellyeahdetroit.com/2014/01/26/watch-battling-blight-with-blexting/) app.
