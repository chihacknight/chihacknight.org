    <p><strong>Chi Hack Night</strong> is a free, weekly event in Chicago to build, share and learn about civic tech. Our community is at the center of Chicago’s civic technology ecosystem.</p>

    <p>We are the place in Chicago where civic tech partnership and innovation happens, resulting in new non-profits like <a href='https://chihacknight.org/projects/2015/09/01/mrelief.html'>mRelief</a>, citizen advocacy campaigns like <a href='https://chihacknight.org/projects/2015/01/01/my-building-doesnt-recycle.html'>My Building Doesn’t Recycle</a>, and government innovation like the City of Chicago’s <a href='https://chihacknight.org/projects/2016/05/01/e-coli-predictions.html'>Clear Water Project</a>.</p>

    <p>Chi Hack Night will always be free and accessible to all but we need <em>your</em> help to keep it going! In the past, all of our funding has come from corporate sponsorship, but this year, we’re about <strong>$15k short</strong>. We have decided to turn to our community and support it from within.</p>
